# Cruz Roja Ambulance Algorithms

## Winter 2018

### Tips

- Tip 1.  Start simple

- Tip 2.  Look at raw data

- Tip 3.  Be concrete

- Tip 4.  Incremental results

- Tip 5.  Find something interesting

- Tip 6.  Push hard on clean signals

- Tip 7.  Actionable

- Tip 8.  Comparative advantage is key

- Tip 9.  Find solid levers to pull

- Tip 10. Document successes and failures

- Tip 11. Inspect outliers

- Tip 12. Eliminate sources of bias



### Past

In the previous quarter, we accomplished the following:

- Come with a few metrics. These included
	- _Overall coverage_: x/y where x is number of covered demand points 
	and y the size of the set of bases
	- _Disruption_: (x1-x2)/y where x1 is the original covered demand
	points, x2 is the loss in coverage, and y is the total number of bases. 

	- _Travel Time_: t where t is the number of seconds it takes for 
	an ambulance to leave the base and arrive at the patient.

	- _Desirability (new)_: a new relational metric between disruption and 
	travel time

### Summary 
- Using numpy to program high level study 

### Suggestions
- Find the closest base to demand points

- Be able to change the radius from the ambulance

- Map the ambulance to the closest base
