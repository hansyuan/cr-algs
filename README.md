# Cruz Roja Ambulance Algorithms

## Winter 2018

### Past

In the previous quarter, we accomplished the following:

- Come with a few metrics. These included

	- _Overall coverage_: x/y where x is number of covered demand points 
	and y the size of the set of bases

	- _Disruption_: (x1-x2)/y where x1 is the original covered demand
	points, x2 is the loss in coverage, and y is the total number of bases. 

	- _Travel Time_: t where t is the number of seconds it takes for 
	an ambulance to leave the base and arrive at the patient.

	- _Desirability (new)_: a new relational metric between disruption and 
	travel time

### Summary 
- Using numpy to program high level study 

### Suggestions
- Find the closest base to demand points

- Be able to change the radius from the ambulance

- Map the ambulance to the closest base
